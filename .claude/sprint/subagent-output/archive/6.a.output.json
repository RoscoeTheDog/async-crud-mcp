    "implementation_plan": "This story makes 3 targeted edits to pyproject.toml to align with the project spec:\n\n1. Change `requires-python` from '>=3.12' to '>=3.10' for broader compatibility.\n2. Add `mcp>=1.0.0` to [project.dependencies] (spec AC-d1.3 requires it as a core dependency alongside fastmcp).\n3. Update `[tool.ruff] target-version` from 'py312' to 'py310' to match the new minimum Python version.\n\nNo source code changes are needed. The codebase already uses `X | Y` union syntax (PEP 604) which is available in Python 3.10+. No Python 3.12-exclusive features (type statement aliases, ExceptionGroup builtins) are used. One file (config_init.py) uses `from __future__ import annotations` which is fine.\n\nThe `mcp` package is a separate PyPI package from `fastmcp` - the spec requires both as explicit dependencies. While fastmcp may transitively depend on mcp, the spec mandates it as an explicit core dependency.\n\nAfter edits, run the full test suite to confirm nothing breaks (AC-6.4).",

Verified no 3.12-exclusive syntax in codebase (no type aliases via `type X = ...`, no ExceptionGroup builtins). PEP 604 union syntax (`str | None`) used throughout is 3.10+ compatible.",
      "AC-6.2": "Add `\"mcp>=1.0.0\",` to the [project.dependencies] list in pyproject.toml. Insert it after the existing `\"fastmcp>=2.0\",` line (line 12) to keep related MCP packages grouped together. This satisfies spec AC-d1.3 which lists mcp>=1.0.0 as a core dependency.",
      "AC-6.3": "Edit pyproject.toml line 58: change `target-version = \"py312\"` to `target-version = \"py310\"` under [tool.ruff]. This ensures ruff linting rules match the new minimum Python version and won't flag syntax that is valid for 3.10+.",
