Created LockEntry, FileLock, and LockManager classes with full support for concurrent reads, exclusive writes, timeout handling, starvation prevention, dual-lock deadlock prevention, and TTL-based persistence. Updated core/__init__.py to export LockManager, LockTimeout, and LockType. Created comprehensive test suite with 17 tests covering all acceptance criteria.",
