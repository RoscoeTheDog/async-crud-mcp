# Story 14: Enhance README with full spec documentation

## Description

The README.md has basic content but is missing significant spec requirements: (1) Installation instructions referencing setup.bat/setup.sh; (2) Usage examples for CLI commands (bootstrap, daemon, config, setup, install); (3) Architecture overview with two-layer design (bootstrap layer + MCP server layer). Currently just has a brief overview and basic getting started.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-14.1: Installation instructions (quick install, setup.bat/setup.sh)
- [ ] AC-14.2: Usage examples for CLI commands
- [ ] AC-14.3: Architecture overview with two-layer design

## Context

[Background, constraints - optional]
