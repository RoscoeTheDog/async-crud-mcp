ENTRYPOINT SUMMARY (from CLAUDE.md):
- Version: 1.19.0
- Purpose: Reusable deployment pattern for MCP servers as persistent per-user daemon services
- Placeholders: [APP_NAME]=claude-jsonl-mcp, [DEFAULT_PORT]=8422, [PACKAGE_NAME]=claude_jsonl_mcp
- ADR-009: single [APP_NAME] convention (lowercase-hyphenated)
- Templates describe architecture, snippets are actual source files to copy
- 10 templates, 32 snippets, 14 ADRs

DIRECTORY DISCOVERY (execute in order):
1. Read the CLAUDE.md entrypoint (already summarized above - skip re-reading)
2. Read ALL files in templates/ for deliverable descriptions
3. Read ALL files in resources/SSOT/ for canonical requirements:
   - Design principles (mandates, constraints)
   - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs with specific values/thresholds)
   - Directory structure expectations
   - Port assignments, manifests, schemas
4. List (but do not read in full) snippets/ to catalog available reference implementations
5. Read resources/helpers/ for validation criteria and checklists
6. Read resources/appendices/ for non-functional requirements (security, testing, platform paths)

TARGET PROJECT: C:\Users\Admin\Documents\GitHub\async-crud-mcp
(This is the project the spec will be compared against in drift analysis)

For each deliverable, extract:
- id: Unique identifier (e.g., "d1", "d2", ...)
- path: Expected relative file path in the TARGET PROJECT
- description: What this deliverable does
- type: "file" | "module" | "config" | "script" | "test" | "doc"
- spec_section: The spec file or section this deliverable comes from
  (e.g., "CONFIG.template.md", "section 3.2")
- acceptance_criteria: List of specific requirements with verifiable signals
- supporting_context: List of non-template files that inform this deliverable's
  requirements (ADRs, design principles, snippets, appendices). Include the file
  path relative to SPEC_PATH and a brief note on relevance.

Write the result to: C:\Users\Admin\Documents\GitHub\async-crud-mcp\.claude\sprint\tmp\spec-manifest.json

Schema:
{

    }
  ]
}

Set input_mode to "template_repo".

context_files: Top-level array of ALL non-template files discovered during directory
traversal (SSOT, snippets, helpers, appendices).

supporting_context: Per-deliverable array of files that inform that specific
deliverable's requirements.

For verifiable_signal: describe what a code reviewer would look for to confirm
the AC is met (class names, method signatures, config keys, behavior patterns).
Incorporate specific values from ADRs/principles when available.

IMPORTANT: Include EVERY deliverable mentioned in the spec. Do not skip files
that seem minor (setup scripts, configs, test files). The drift analysis depends
on completeness.

IMPORTANT: When input_mode is "template_repo", requirements may be spread across
templates, SSOT, snippets, and appendices. A deliverable's acceptance criteria
should reflect ALL sources, not just the template text. Cross-reference SSOT
files to enrich ACs with specific thresholds, values, and constraints.

IMPORTANT: The target project is async-crud-mcp (a JSONL-based CRUD MCP server).
Map deliverable paths to the actual project structure. Read the project's directory
structure to understand where files are located. The project uses:
- src/async_crud_mcp/ as the main package directory
- scripts/ for installation scripts
- tests/ for test files
- pyproject.toml for build config
