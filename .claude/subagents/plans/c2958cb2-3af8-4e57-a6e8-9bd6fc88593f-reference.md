**Approved**: 2026-02-17T05:25:38Z
**Session**: c2958cb2-3af8-4e57-a6e8-9bd6fc88593f

## Research Files

These files contain full architectural context for implementation.
Read them when creating sprint stories or implementing changes.

| # | File | Scope | Est. Words |
|---|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | `/c/Users/Admin/Documents/GitHub/async-crud-mcp/.claude/subagents/plans/c2958cb2-3af8-4e57-a6e8-9bd6fc88593f-plan.md` | Path-based access control: hierarchical config, PathValidator extension, destructive tool updates | ~1391 |

## Reading Instructions

Each research file follows the plan-output-schema format:
- **Context**: What was investigated and why
- **Findings**: Architecture analysis, code paths with file:line references, dependencies
- **Recommendations**: Implementation strategy, trade-offs, risks, prerequisites
- **Files Identified**: Table of files to modify with line ranges and relevance

When implementing:
1. Read the research file(s) listed above
2. Use Findings for understanding current state and dependency chains
3. Use Recommendations for approach and trade-off decisions
4. Use Files Identified for exact file paths and line ranges to modify
